This is a project that I am using to teach myself full stack web development. I have been dicking around on this project for awhile now, I have not been the most productive that I possibly could as it is more of a learning tool than an actual business I am trying to run. I guess I am just playing around trying to see what works and what does not. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap4, jQuery, Node.js, Epress and much more. This project has given me so much more confidence in my ability to code effectively.
